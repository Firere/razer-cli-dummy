# razer-cli-dummy
This was made to mimic the razer-cli binary resulting from compiling https://github.com/phush0/razer-laptop-control-no-dkms.
It has all the same outputs, but does not actually do anything. It was made for testing with the GUI for the same program.

Or at least it would've if I ever bothered finishing the GUI. I've pushed the code that I did write (both for this dummy and the GUI) to GitHub to archive it, however it was never finished and this dummy will not, in fact, give you the same outputs as the actual `razer-cli`.
